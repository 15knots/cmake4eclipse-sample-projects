A cmake project with language CUDA enabled.

This project shows that the nvcc compiler is detected and the include paths
defined in CMakeLists.txt are fed to the indexer.
You will need to install the Nsight Eclipse Plugin for the cude code editor.

Caution: Since openSUSE42.3 only comes with cmake 3.5, the project is configured to use a manually installed version of cmake 3.10. 
You might wish to adjust that in the project settings.
