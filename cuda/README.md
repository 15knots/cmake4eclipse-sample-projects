A cmake project with language CUDA enabled.

This project shows that the nvcc compiler is detected and the include paths
defined in CMakeLists.txt are fed to the indexer.
You will need to install the 
- `Nsight Eclipse Plugin` for the cuda code editor and
- `CDT indexer support for NVidia CUDA compilers` plugin (from the marketplace).
